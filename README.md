# OpenGL-Renderer
Experimental renderer

## Overview
This renderer was inspired by DOOM 2016 and I wrote it purely to experiment with modern rendering techniques. It is far 
from complete in any sense.

## Features
1. Sparse Virtual Texturing
2. Forward Clustered Lighting
3. HDR & Linear Correct Workflow
4. Analytical & Image Based PBR
6. Spherical Harmonics for diffuse irradiance
5. Post processing: SSAO & Bloom with lens dirt
6. Shader Hot Loading
